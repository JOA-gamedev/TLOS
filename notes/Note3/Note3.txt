//TODO: fix whole references issue - fix cards not letting go
// why does the .og_pos not work??


clearly if i set the reference to the object to noone then it stops tracking
maybe i should deactivate the reference upon dropping?

im already doing it it just doesnt work, lets clean up the code first
(i coded this at 3 am yesterday / today)

im thinking so hard rn
