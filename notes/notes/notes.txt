//TODO: fix whole references issue - fix cards not letting go
// why does the .og_pos not work??


clearly if i set the reference to the object to noone then it stops tracking
maybe i should deactivate the reference upon dropping?

im already doing it it just doesnt work, lets clean up the code first
(i coded this at 3 am yesterday / today)

im thinking so hard rn


apperantly the only thing that works as expected is this card which is not attached to anything, 
by clicking it i can move it, and if i drop the reference it wont follow the mouse anymore
bruh, i apperantly made a new instance. okay now lets try to solve the issue at hand

IT WORKS!

ive got it working for the last 3 cards, now ive got to figure out whats happening in the first one


ive shortened the code with chatgpt, also the reason why 1 was not working was because there where 2 instances behind eachother apperantly


next up: making the card which is placed upon, jump to the og_pos of the card being placed!


reference naar de kaart die ik vasthou,
